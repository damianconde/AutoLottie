AutoLottie
========== 

AutoLottie is an Outlook add-in that lets you schedule reminders for the email you sent.  As you are composing a message,
you can click a 'Schedule Nag' button and select a time.  Then, when you send, reminders will be sent to the recipient 
(with you copied) until you receive a reply to the conversation.

This is still in development.
